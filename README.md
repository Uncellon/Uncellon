### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

So, let's begin! My name is Dmitry Plastinin and I'm system engineer. Or not, hard to say, since now I work in a small company whose activities are related to the production of reverse-vending machines which are called "fandomats". I develop everything - from controller software to real-time monitoring on WebSockets. You can find several repositories on my GitHub page that I use successfully in our production software.
